## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Sqas Sajed, an Chinese undergraduate student major in Physics at Xi'an Jiaotong University.You can call me any way you want.
I'm interested in theoretical physics, mainly formal high energy physics theory, and I keenly want to communicate someone who shares my interestsðŸ¥ºðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
I'm currently learning String theory and physics about scattering amplitude, which are tough but interesting in some wayðŸ¤“ Especially tough when you try to apply for a Master/PHDðŸ˜Ž

Besides physics, I have a vast range of interests:

ðŸŽµ: I'm recently listening to thrash metal(Trivium, Megadeth,...), power metal(Heavenly, Dragonforce,...), prog metal (dream theater,...), J-pop(Yorushika, ZTMY,...). And I really love classical pieces composed by Liszt, Brahms, Chopin, Mahler, Scriabin,...

ðŸŽ¹ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¤: Iâ€™ve been practising piano since I was 4 years old, and I am trying to recover my ability to sing these days. Moreover, I started to learn guitar recently.

ðŸŽ®: I'm mostly a pvp gamer, playing APEX(Rank Diamond S14 when I'd only play less than 200h) and League of Legend. And I do play rhythm games(Arcaea, CytusI/II, Deemo,...), Sandbox games(like Minecraft), and RPG games.

ðŸ“•: I'm very interested in the theory of psychoanalysis, but I've only read a few books about it based on humanism and watched some online lessons.

âŒ¨: I'm not a computer science/engineering major student, so I didn't learn much about coding() I've only studied a little matlab(mainly computational physics), python, C++, Latex, Mathematica.

You can contact me through the email presented in my profile, feel free to ask questions about Physics or anything you want to know about me.
